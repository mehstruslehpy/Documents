FOR THE SAKE OF HONESTY I HAVE LEFT MY NON WORKING CODE HERE! 
	I could not find the source of why realloc was causing sigabort I guess I need to get better at tracking that sort of stuff down
	The stack becomes fairly 'used' and irrelevant by the time I hit my bug. The function lval_pop that contains the realloc that
	causes the sigabort seems fine which leads me to believe the error is earlier in the execution of the program which could be anywhere..
	the book didn't do a very good job in explaining the purpose of linking lvals/lenvs into some goofy listy looking structure that transforms
	mpc_ast_t structures contents. Seems odd.. I may debug further but I'm not sure if I will or not yet..

    › Define a Lisp function that returns the first element from a list.
		def {first} (\ {list} {head (list)})
    › Define a Lisp function that returns the second element from a list.
		def {second} (\ {i & xs} {head xs})
		will return the second argument? I am not sure if a list is "a b c d", "(a b c d)", or "{a b c d}"
		example: "second 1 2 3 4" returns two
    › Define a Lisp function that calls a function with two arguments in reverse order.
		def {input} (\ {x y} {list x y})
		def {output} (\ {x y} {input y x})
    › Define a Lisp function that calls a function with arguments, then passes the result to another function.
		def {var-mul} (\ {x y} {* x y})

    › Change variable arguments so at least one extra argument must be supplied before it is evaluated.
		def {mul-hun}(\ {x y} {var-mul 10 (mul-ten x)})
