› What does the strcpy function do?
	it copies the first parameter of its input into the second parameter of its input:	strcopy(src, dest);
› What does the realloc function do?
	changes the size of the memory block pointed to by ptr to size bytes:	realloc(ptr, size;
› What does the memmove function do?
	copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest:	memmove(dest, src, n)
› How does memmove differ from memcpy?
	For memcpy:
		The areas must not overlap (they can overlap with memmove)
	For memmove:
		The areas can overlap. The results from src are first copied into a temporary array that does not overlap src or dest.
