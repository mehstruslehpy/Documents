› Run the previous chapter's code through gdb and crash it. See what happens.

	I used gdb's expression print 'Expr = 0xbadbeef' I did this to all parsers. The program segfaulted inside of one of the functions in mpc.c
	I thought it was kinda cool because I got used to steps, next, info locals to check variables, bt full to check the stack, and I also found out
	that the gnu info command has a key ('H') to view keybinds by default	

› How do you give an enum a name?

› What are union data types and how do they work?
	
	They're like a struct but they can only be of one type at a time and should only occupy the space of the largest data type

› What are the advantages over using a union instead of struct?

	I've heard they can be used for padding out structs.. I'd bet they're more useful as a thing that can be only one thing at a time..
	Like a 'state' thing? They also have the advantage of being a constant size.. The sizeof the biggest element..

› Can you use a union in the definition of lval?
	
	Why couldn't you? an lval should just be a struct

› Extend parsing and evaluation to support the remainder operator %.

	This was done in the previous example I may implement it back into the main code eventually

› Extend parsing and evaluation to support decimal types using a double field.
