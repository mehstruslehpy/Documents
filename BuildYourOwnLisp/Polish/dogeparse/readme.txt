I'm surprised this even partially works.. Looks like we just needed to "?tokenize?" (is that even the right word?) all of our strings in our language via "quotes"

You can kind of fake out the parser though.. With strings like: wowow langlanguage lislisp manu etc. I guess it just assumes after the first few characters..
