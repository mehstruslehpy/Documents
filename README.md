<h1>Welcome to my repository!<h1>

I use this repo as storage for various code projects.

Not all of this is my code..

I am doing my best to mark where I am using somebody elses code, so just get in contact if you feel
you are improperly creditted.

The organization is semi-random. I just make new directories for different endeavours, lisp is for lisp, reddragonbook is for a book etc..
