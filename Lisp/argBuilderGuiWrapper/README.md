# What this directory is for:
This directory contains a gui program for building random arguments as pdf's in either first order or propositional logic.
# Things you will need to run this program:
- xdg-open: opens your pdf viewer, if you do not have xdg-open you can instead use your preferred pdf viewer but you will need to change this by hand.
- a pdf viewer for xdg-open to use
- sbcl: the core of the argument building program is a lisp script I wrote using sbcl.
- sed: filters the argbuilder script output to tex
- pdflatex: converts the tex file to a pdf file
- tcl/tk since the gui is written for the wish shell
