OUTPUT-COMMENTS:
	examples: ;in our output code
			  ;anything starting with a semi-colon is a comment

IF STATEMENTS:
	examples:	if (1+2) then (3+4);
				if (1+2) then 3+4; 5 * 6;
				if 1+2 then (3+4); 5 * 6;
				etc...

	//the test expression needs to have parenthesis but the expression after it does not
	template:	if (expr1) then (expr2); ...
				if (expr1) then expr2; ...
				if expr1 then (expr2); ...
				if expr1 then expr2; ...

WHILE STATEMENTS:
	examples:	while (1+2) do (3+4);
				while (1+2) do 3+4;
				while 1+2 do (3+4);
				while 1+2 do 3+4;
	
	template:
				while (expr1) do (expr2);
				while (expr1) do expr2;
				while expr1 do (expr2);
				while expr1 do expr2;
			
ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS:
	examples:	x := 1 + 2;		//pops the value leftover from 1+2 from the stack into the eax and stores it elsewhere..
	
	emplate:
				x := expr;		//same deal
			

I am not entirely sure if I did or did not break anything by implementing things this way..
