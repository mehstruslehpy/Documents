I made this on my phone using c4droid originally so I apologize for the poor syntax.
The program is wrong, it generates an ip with 4 matching octets. I think I would need to reseed rand using srand() for each iteration of my loop
for this program to work correctly.
Right now I am too busy

I'm mostly just committing this to keep it somewhere so I can someday fix it.
