The functions are currently documented either by browsing the \hyperlink{Shapes_8h}{Shapes.\+h} source yourself or viewing the documentation included inside of the html subdirectory

Shapes.\+c is an example program example\+Proj is another example but this time via a static library test contains some test programs and scripts, these might be good for checking out what this library can do

the outer makefile can be used either to build the Shapes.\+c program via running make or to build lib\+Shapes.\+a via

running\+: \textquotesingle{}make library\textquotesingle{} will build libshapes.\+a for using shapes as a library

running\+: \textquotesingle{}make test\textquotesingle{} will build the testing tools and programs inside of ./test

running\+: \textquotesingle{}make clean\textquotesingle{} cleans out any build files and rebuilds the documentation

{\bfseries B\+U\+GS\+:}

Because each (x,y) element in the plane needs to be a discrete integer there is a loss of \textquotesingle{}resolution\textquotesingle{} in certain lines. Essentially as the slope gets steeper more points are lost due to the nature of drawing with discrete \textquotesingle{}cells\textquotesingle{}

This effect can be noticed in Line Segments and also in Triangles

I have fixed it for perfectly vertical lines hence why Rectangles and Squares work fine
