'Eat the Ats' is a really ugly command line game I've been working on.

You run it like this:

EatTheAts SampleMap1.src 5

Where SampleMap1.src is a map, and 5 is the game speed from 5-1 with 5 being the slowest.

I also created a map maker program all it really does is take the user created map file and
translates it into a plain text notation that looks a teensy bit like those odd init-lists 
for multidimensional arrays. It's probably not the greatest design but whatever it works
if you use it right.

It outputs to stdout so use your shell redirect operators:

mapMaker myCoolMap.txt > myCoolMap.src

I would also recommend not believing the ROW and COL counts at the end of the .src file
I added that in then realized I did not need it but was too lazy to take it out.

To make maps use these characters in your favorite text editor:
    # <= this is a wall.
    @ <= this is an at, the player character must eat all of these in your map to win.
    M <= this is a monster, it will try to eat the player character.

    l <= use this to end a row
    e <= use this on a separate line to signify the end of your map

The monsters need whitespace to move or the engine will freeze.

I don't recall testing this with nonrectangular maps, if you want that sort of thing you
should use walls creatively.

The map editor is whitespace sensitive don't leave whitespace after an 'l' or 'e' don't 
leave whitespaces that you don't want.

Sometimes monsters disappear I should probably figure out why at some point
