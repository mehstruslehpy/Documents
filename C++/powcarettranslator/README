this is a translator/preprocessor for caret style exponentiations into functional form
for example:
	x^y will be translated to pow(x, y)
it searches every line in a file for the caret symbol when it finds a caret it iterates over that line replacing instances
of the caret notation for the function notation

you can escape translation of caret symbols by using the comment //bitwise directly above lines that you do not want to get translated

//any other line that does not have a caret symbol should just get copied directly as is into the translated file

the demo_expressions.cpp sample file will not compile using g++ on its own
but if you translate it with my preprocessor/translator it will output a file called translated.cpp that will compile perfectly into a working
program

you really only need these files:

	main.cpp, caretPow.cpp, caretPow.h

and boost installed..
