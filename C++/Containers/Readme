The following code contains several different container classes based off of
a class I implemented from a course I took.

CARRAY:
	-an array that uses dynamic memory to grow as needed
LList: 
	-a linked list the supports all the features of a carray except virtual indices
CStack:
	-a stack implemented in terms of a carray
LStack:
	-a stack implemented in terms of an llist 
CList: 
	-a list implemented in terms of a carray
