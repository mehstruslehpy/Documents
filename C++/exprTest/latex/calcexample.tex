\section*{The Calculator Translator}

The calculator translator is a tool to turn lists of well formed formulas along with variables in the language of propositional logic into here documents that you can run for calculations on the prover. The calculator translator outputs lines such as {\itshape F\+I\+LE\+:$<$some output goes here$>$} as a way of showing the user what specifically gets output to the here document being created. The calculator translator will prompt the user as to whether they are done entering in formulas to be evaluated if yes then the calculator translator moves on to prompting for values to use per each variable. Variables are assigned from top to bottom left to right as described in the here document file documentation

\section*{An Example Session}

Note\+: User input has been marked with a \textquotesingle{}user$>$\textquotesingle{} symbol and \textquotesingle{}F\+I\+LE\+:\textquotesingle{} statements have been omitted ~\newline
 ~\newline
 {\itshape  {\ttfamily  Please Enter a formula\+:~\newline
 user$>$ (A-\/$>$B)~\newline
 Last\+Formula?(y/n)~\newline
 user$>$ n~\newline
 Please Enter a formula\+:~\newline
 user$>$ (A\&(Bv(C-\/$>$E)))~\newline
 Last\+Formula?(y/n)~\newline
 user$>$ n~\newline
 Please Enter a formula\+:~\newline
 user$>$ F~\newline
 Last\+Formula?(y/n)~\newline
 user$>$ y~\newline
 Please choose a 1 for true or 0 for false for each variable that follows\+:~\newline
 A = user$>$ 1~\newline
 B = user$>$ 1~\newline
 C = user$>$ 0~\newline
 E = user$>$ 0~\newline
 F = user$>$ 1~\newline
 } }

After the translator is completed you may need to give the newly generated here document execute permissions since it is effectively a script. On my system I do that with the command \textquotesingle{}chmod +x output\+\_\+heredoc.\+txt\textquotesingle{}

As you can probably guess the above input represents the following list of formulas and values\+: ~\newline
 ~\newline
 {\itshape  {\ttfamily  (A -\/$>$ B)~\newline
 (A \& (B v (C -\/$>$ E)))~\newline
 F~\newline
 ~\newline
 A = 1~\newline
 B = 1~\newline
 C = 0~\newline
 E = 0~\newline
 F = 1~\newline
 } }

And when ran for calculation produces the following\+:

{\ttfamily  {\itshape  Dumping context\+:~\newline
 A=1~\newline
 B=1~\newline
 C=0~\newline
 E=0~\newline
 F=1~\newline
 Beginning calculation step enter q to quit\+:~\newline
 (A -\/$>$ B) = 1~\newline
 (A \& (B v (C -\/$>$ E))) = 1~\newline
 F = 1~\newline
 } } ~\newline
 Which is the correct output.
